# mobile_intern_assignment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a code test.

Link Deploy Demo:
- [Firebase](https://fir-app-web-dd047.web.app)
- [Codemagic](https://ltnam432002_mobile_intern_assignment.codemagic.app)

For install:
 - Run 'flutter pub get' in terminal
 - Run 'flutter run' in terminal

Evaluate my project:
 - Features 'Added product doesn't have Add To Cart button anymore, it should have Check Mark Icon (âœ“) instead.' is not completed. I tried to think of solutions but they seem to be useless, the data returned has changed but for some reason the status here receives an error result. I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
 - I still do not understand much about deploying a product, when I deploy this website, it has errors in assets so it does not fully display what I coded.
 - Because while learning I accidentally learned about codemagic to deploy the product, I gave it a try. I hope you'll enjoy it. But unfortunately it is as faulty as firebase.

# **Thanks so much for taking the time to read my project, I look forward to hearing from the company soon. Thanks a lot.**
